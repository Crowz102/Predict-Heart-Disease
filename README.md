# Cardiovascular Disease Detection Project

This project focuses on detecting signs of cardiovascular disease using machine learning techniques. The goal is to compare the accuracy of three different models: Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Random Forest.

## Project Structure

- **`heart_disease_detection.ipynb`**: This Jupyter Notebook contains the data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation processes. It walks through the steps of loading the data, applying the three machine learning models, and comparing their performance in terms of accuracy.
- **`heart_disease_data.csv`**: The dataset used in this project, which includes various medical parameters that are potential indicators of cardiovascular disease.

## Models Used

1. **Logistic Regression**: A linear model used for binary classification problems.
2. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: A non-parametric method used for classification.
3. **Random Forest**: An ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to improve the model's performance.

## Results

The models are evaluated based on their accuracy in predicting the presence of cardiovascular disease. The results of the comparison are included in the notebook.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the `heart_disease_detection.ipynb` file in JupyterLab or any compatible environment.
3. Run the notebook to see the results and analysis.

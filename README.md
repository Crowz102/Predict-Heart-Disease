# Cardiovascular Disease Detection Project

This project focuses on detecting signs of cardiovascular disease using machine learning models. The dataset provided in a CSV file is used to train and evaluate three different models: Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Random Forest. After comparing their accuracy, the Random Forest model was selected for its superior performance.

## Project Structure

- **notebook.ipynb**: The Jupyter Notebook containing all the code for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and comparison of the three machine learning models.
- **dataset.csv**: The dataset used for training and evaluating the models.
- **model.pkl**: The trained Random Forest model, saved as a .pkl file for later use.

## Usage

To run the project, you can clone this repository and open the `notebook.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook. The notebook contains step-by-step instructions and code for replicating the results.

## Installation

To install the necessary dependencies, you can use the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
